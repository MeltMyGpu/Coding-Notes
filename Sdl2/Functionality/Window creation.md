# Initialisation

Before we do anything with SDL, we need to initialise it!

```rust
let sdl = sdl2::init().unwrap();
```

`sdl2::init()`Â returns an enumÂ `Result<Sdl, String>`, we useÂ `unwrap()`Â here to handle the possible error of a failed startup, if the enum returns ok, it will give us our Sdl struct, if it has an Er, itâ€™s will return the string andÂ `unwrap()`Â will terminate our program.

Now we have our SDL struct initialised as an object.

### // OpenGL attributes config //

In order to use OpenGL as our graphics API, we need to set some attributes for it before our window is created, in our case here, we are going to create a reference to our video systems OpenGL attributes, then set the context profile to â€˜coreâ€™ mode, and finally set the version of OpenGL which we are going to use, in this case 4.5.

<aside> ðŸ“¢ NOTE: It is safer for backward compatibility to have the default version load 3.3. It is possible to then load in features of higher versions when required based on a systems check.

</aside>

```rust
let gl_attr = video_subsystem.gl_attr(); // creates OpenGL to allow us to set some attributes and enable minimal openGL
gl_attr.set_context_profile(sdl2::video::GLProfile::Core);
// sets us to using core
gl_attr.set_context_version(4,5);
// sets version (using recent version, turn to 3.3 if having issues )
```


## Creating a window with OpenGL

Weâ€™re going to be using the video subsystem to get a builder of the Vsub, configure it, and then construct it, this will internally contain a close of our SDL object (see overview).

```rust
let video_subsystem = sdl.video().unwrap();
// OpenGl attribute config //
let window = video_subsystem
    .window("title",900,700)
    .OpenGL() // configues window to recieve OpenGl context
    .resizable()
    .build()
    .unwrap();
'main: loop{
// window / application event loop
}// once built the window will remain open while in scope, this loop ensures the window stays open.
```
